# SSL Certificate Directory

Place your SSL certificates here:
- fullchain.pem (or cert.pem)
- privkey.pem (or key.pem)

For development, you can generate self-signed certificates:
```bash
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \
  -keyout privkey.pem -out fullchain.pem \
  -subj "/CN=localhost"
```

For production, use Let's Encrypt certificates.
